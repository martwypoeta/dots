# martwypoeta/dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repo. Everything in here is managed via [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

> [!NOTE]
> These are my personal dotfiles. The docs below are meant for my use only and arenâ€™t guaranteed to work everywhere. If you want to use them, fork the repo and customize it to fit your own setup.

## Installation

You can install them with:

```bash
% chezmoi init --apply martwypoeta
```

Or if you'd like to exclude encrypted files, use:

```bash
% chezmoi init --apply --exclude=encrypted martwypoeta
```
